# Monster_Survival2
Re-building the previous version of my game, Monster_Survival.

Game Design:
---------------
 - Game Design will pursue a more asthetic game than my previous game :P
   * Might still be sticky figures, but they will be more detailed, or maybe no more sticky figures haha.

 - Player in the previous version of the game had an inventory system, this will be the same case here but it will be easier to see and access.

 - Items/Powerups will be explained in the main menu and they will be easily identifiable in-game.
 
 - Level design will be a little more expanded, either the player will be smaller or the game world will be bigger.

 - Same point of the game, survive as many waves as possible.
